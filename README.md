# N315 Final Project
- For this final project, it will be an e-commerce site. My site will resemble this site: https://www.keurig.com/c/coffeemakers101?cm_sp=bo+cybermonday21-_-promo+hero+banner-_-shop+coffee+makers.

- Details:
- All of this should resemble the site.
- I made sure that each product displayed:
- Product image
- Product name
- Product price
- "Buy Now" button
- Every time the "Buy Now" button is clicked, it triggers an alert displaying "item added to cart," but it is also added to the shopping cart page, and the shopping cart icon increments the number based on the number of products added.
- I loaded all the products from a JSON file onto the page to facilitate cart management. To enhance the user experience, I stored any additional data in JSON, which was kept in memory and not saved upon refreshing the page. Alternatively, local storage in the browser could be used.
