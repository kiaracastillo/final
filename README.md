# N315 Final Project
-For this final project, I will be using Firebase's authentication and adding it to my project. My final project will be an e-commerce site. I must have a shopping cart, log in and create an account page, and show at least 10 coffee machines.
- My site resemble this site: https://www.keurig.com/c/coffeemakers101?cm_sp=bo+cybermonday21-_-promo+hero+banner-_-shop+coffee+makers.
- Details:
- All of this must look like the site.
- I need to show a cart icon in the top right-hand corner that displays the count of how many coffee makers I have purchased. When I click on my cart page, it should show all the coffee makers I have clicked the "buy now" button on.
- I ensured that each product displayed:
- Product image
- Product name
- Product price
- Buy now button
- I decided to keep the site appearance consistent and loaded all the products from a JSON file onto the page for easier cart management. To enhance user experience, I stored any additional data in JSON, which was held in memory and not saved upon page refresh. Alternatively, local storage in the browser could be used.
